delwiche-sampler

This project converts a Velleman K8200 or 3Drag 3d printer into an autosampler.

Instructions for assembling the printer can be found here: http://www.k8200.eu/manual/building/
For this project do not assemble the coil support, heated bed, or extruder.

The parts used to replace the extruder can be 3d printed, the OpenSCAD files are in the "3D parts" folder.

Photos of the assembled extruder replacement can be found in the "pictures" folder.
